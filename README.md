# KnowledgeBase
A collection of knowledge articles from my work within IT. This is formulated from real work experience, homelab and studying.
Within this colleciton I have; installations, configurations, problem solutions and much more.

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) system. The articles uploaded here are my notes that I have saved in my IT section of my PKM.

This forms the inital articles that get written up more formally with images into blog posts on my website: https://knowledgeaddict.co.uk/
