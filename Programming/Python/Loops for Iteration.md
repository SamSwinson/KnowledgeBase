- you can carry out a task multiple times

While loop:
  - while a statement is true carry out this code
  - need to use an iteration variable to control the amount of times the loop will iterate or you will end up with an infinite loop
  - indefinite loop - keeps going until something is false

Break:
  - exits the loop and goes to whatever the first line of code under the loop is

Continue:
  - exits the current iteration of the loop and goes back up to the top of the loop

For loop:
  - definite loop - runs for a defined number of times

What can you do in a loop:
  - loop to see the largest amount
  - counting loop
  - total sum loop to keep a running total
  - calculate the average loop
  - filtering in a loop:
    - look for something with if e.g. <20
  - search in a loop using a Boolean variable:
    - true or false
    - find a certain number in a loop for example
  - find the smallest number so far:
    - use the "None" variable type
    - start your smallest variable with None then use the first iteration count in the for loop to input the start number into the smallest variable
    - use if to put in the first value
    - if smallest is None:

Is and Is Not:
  - they are operators
  - "is" is similar to == but it requires the same value and the same data type
  - it's good for Booleans and None types
