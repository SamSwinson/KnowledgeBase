- store and repeat multiple lines of code
- this allows repeated code to be more reliable and if you had to change code you had used multiple times throughout your program you only have to change it in one place, the function
- def = define the function

- define a function:
  - def function-name(optional arguments)
  - example:
    - def hello(language)
  - the function is expecting to see something passed in when you define the function with an optional argument
  - if it doesn't see what its expecting it will stop the code with a traceback
  - you can have multiple optional arguments and they will go into the function code in the same order as they apear

- calling the function:
  - you call the function by typing the defined function_name(with the optional arguments if stated) in the main body of the code

- returning value:
  - you return a value using the return function
  - this will return a chosen result into a variable stated
  - the return function can be used to break out of the function in the same way the break function stops a loop
