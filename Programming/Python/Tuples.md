- a tuple functions like a list
- for example:
  - x = ('sam', 'jeff')
  - x = (9, 10, 23)
  - (x, y) = (4, 'Fred')
- tuples are immutable, they cannot be changed once they have been created
- if the data you want to put into a list only needs to be recalled or viewed then use a tuple
- a tuple is more efficient in the way it uses memory because it doesn't have the option to append or change values
- tuples are comparable like strings are

Sorted:
  - the sorted function allows us to sort lists of tuples
  - sorted(reverse = True)
  - can use sorted in a loop to print out items
