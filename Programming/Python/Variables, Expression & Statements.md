- Constant - fixed value
           - never changes
- Reserved words - pre-determined functions: - if
                                             - else
                                             - print
- Variable - a container box you can assign a value to
           - this container is a piece of memory used to store the value that can later be re-called by the program
           - assign the value in an assignment statement
           - value can be changed
           - we choose the name: - make it memorable
                                 - helps allow the programmer to understand the use of the variable
                                 - Mnemonic
- Assignment statement - for example - x = 3 * 4
                       - is completed the expression and then drops that value into the variable

Expressions:
- they are used in assignment statements
/ - divide
% - remainder
* - multiply
** - power
- Operator precedence - Parenthesis
                      - Power
                      - Multiplication
                      - Addition
                      - Left to Right

Type:
- string - Str() - characters in a line - "hello"
- integer - Int() - a whole number - 1
- float - float() - a decimal number - 1.1
- integer division always produces a float in Python3
- you can convert between the data types
- user input - input() - prints a string of text waiting for a user response
                       - gives you back a string data type
- comments - # - python will ignore this line in the code
