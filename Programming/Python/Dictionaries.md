- it is an in memory database
- list:
  - a linear collection of values that stay in order
- dictionary:
  - a bag of values, each with their own labels
  - you define the label which acts as a container within the dictionary

Create empty dictionary:
  - dict()
  - dictionaryname = {}

How dictionaries are laid out:
  - dictionaryname ['label'] = value
  - dictionaryname = {'key':value, 'key':value}

Get method:
  - dictionaryname.get(key, default value)
  - this will looks through the dictionary to see if the key is already created, if no then it will create that key with the default value assigned into the value
