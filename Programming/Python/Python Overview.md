Python as a language:
- Invented by Guido Van Rossum
- powerful and easy to learn
- Syntax Errors - incorrect way of formulating a command
- Reserved words - pre-determined set of functions in python
- Variable - a container box you can assign a value to
- Sequential steps - starts at the top and executes each line then moves onto the next line
- Conditional steps - only carry out a line/set of lines if a condition is met
- Repeated steps (loops) - while a statement is true carry out a line/set of lines
