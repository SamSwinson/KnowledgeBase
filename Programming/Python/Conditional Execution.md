- If - a reserved word
     - if a question/statement is true execute these lines of code
- Operators:
  - < - Less than
  - <== - Less than or equal to
  - == - Equal to
  - > - Greater than
  - >= - Greater than or equal to
  - != - Not equal to
- Idents:
  - python uses 4 spaces for its indentation
  - its a signal for a block of code
  - a : indicates the start of a block of code 

- Two-way decision:
  - if, else
  - if the question/statement is true run this block of code, otherwise (else) run this block of code
- Multi-way decision:
  - if, elif, else
  - if the question/statement is true run this block of code, if the above statement is false check this question/statement and if that's true run this block of code, otherwise run this block of code.

Error detection:
- Try/Except structure:
  - you anticipate a piece of code that may break due to something like a user input.
  - you specify the line of code you want to check within the try statement
  - if that line of code breaks it will look into the except statement for what to do next
  - if the try statement line of code doesn't break it will skip the except line of code and carry on with the rest of the code
